<p>it’s always night inside my skull — yours too, unless there are actual gaping holes in it.<br>
 This proposition would be unremarkable, were it not for my visual experience, which often suggests otherwise.<br>
 What it suggests right now, with me being awake and aware and my eyes open, is that the place from which I look out at the world is just behind the bridge of my nose.<br>
 Even more strikingly, I see what I see through what appears to be a large oval hole in the front of my head.<br>
 But when I feel around with my fingertips in search of it, I find that all is well with my face.<br>
 This can only mean one thing: that the sensory reality that I inhabit is virtual. To put it less gently, I am living a lie.</p>

<p>The realization that the perceived world is virtual immediately leads to another one:<br>
 that what it looks like should depend on the kind of virtual reality engine that one employs.<br>
 Things are likely to look very different for species whose brain, body, and ecology all differ from the human “standard.”<br>
 The same goes even for humans who happen to have special abilities.<br>
 A useful, if fictional, prop for thinking about these matters is Zatōichi, the hero of a long-running action film series in Japan,<br>
 whose prowess with a sword was not in the least impaired by his blindness.<br>
 The trope, which the viewers loved, was that the Blind Swordsman leveled the playing field against sighted opponents by making better use of his <br>
 remaining senses and his other skills. (He did not always play fair: In some fight scenes, he would first cut off the wicks of the candles, plunging everything into darkness.)

<h2 id="about"style="margin-top:500;">How things really are</h2>
<p>If different species, or even different individuals belonging to the same species, inhabit different perceptual worlds,<br>
what can we know about what the real world is like? Clearly enough to make action possible; apart from that, not much.<br>
 Amazingly, the more basic a question about that real world seems, the more difficult it is to get a definitive answer to it.<br>
 Is it dark at night? The sense in which it is for us is of little concern to a bat, and of no concern to a mole.<br>
 Is air thick? Not really to us, but sufficiently so for a swallow to push against during its aerial acrobatics.<br>
 Is water wet? Not to a duck or a water strider. In the face of such differences,<br>
 it seems silly to insist that our perceptual world is somehow privileged or that what we perceive is how things really are.</p>
